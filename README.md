# Coppersmith-Method-for-cryptanalysis

Coppersmith method is used for finding small modular roots of polynomial with known coefficients and known modulus. Mathematically, given a polynomial 
$f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and an integer $r$ such that $f(x) \equiv 0$ mod $N$ as long as $r< N ^{1/d}$ where $d$ is the degree of $f$.
